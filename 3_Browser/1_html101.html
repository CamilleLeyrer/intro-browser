    Hello World!
    <!-- Hi I am your first HTML file! -->
    <!-- The line above was a comment. -->
    <!-- 
        Maybe I am not your first HTML file, 
        but I am your first HTML file of this exercise sheet.
    -->
    <!-- Ah, the lines above were a multi-line comment. -->
    <!--
        This file looks a bit empty, so you are expecting an
        exercise to fill it in?
        
        Right, but first I need to write the name of the sheet:

        //////////////////////////
        Exercise Sheet 1: HTML 101
        //////////////////////////
    -->
    <!-- 
        Now we can start.
        
        Exercise 1. Open this file in the browser.
        //////////////////////////////////////////

        Really easy, but you should do it. Don't expect a solution for this.

        Exercise 2. Fix the doctype
        ////////////////////////////

        The browser will render this (empty) HTML just fine, but you should add
        the DOCTYPE definition on top. What is the DOCTYPE?

        DOCTYPE is the first thing that you should write in an HTML5 document.
        It tells the browser what type of document this is. If you miss it, you
        are probably going to be fine, but there is a chance your browser 
        behaves "quirky."

        Long Hint: In HTML 5, writing the DOCTYPE is really easy:
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype

        In HTML 4.01, it was more complicated and was created quite a few errors
        among developers. You had to write something like:

        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">


        Exercise 3. Add a title (and a head?)
        /////////////////////////////////////

        The browser displays the title of a page inside the tab or on its title
        bar. Sounds a good idea, to add one, right? What about "HTML 101" ?
        Hint: Use the <title> tag.
        Hint2: In HTML 4.01, the <title> tag needed to be inside the <head>
        tag, which should contain all meta information about the web page 
        itself. In HTML 5, you can omit the <head> tag.

        Exercise 4. Hello World (and a body!)
        /////////////////////////////////////

        The page looks still miserably empty and we are already at the fourth 
        exercise. Let's add some content immediately! As you know already, the
        first thing you need to write is: "Hello World".
