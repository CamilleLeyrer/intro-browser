            HTML tags can have attributes.
            A very common attribute is "id", a **unique** identifier
            for the element within the page.

        Exercise Sheet 4: External Scripts.
        ///////////////////////////////////

        Now that we have learned that HTML tags can have attributes, we can discover a few important attributes of the <script> tag. 
    -->

    <!-- 

        Exercise 1. External Scripts
        //////////////////////////////////

        Most of the times you won't write JavaScript code directly inside the HTML page. There are a number of reasons:

        1. It's messier, you wont to separete logic and representation as much as possible (sometimes you even use different editors).
        2. It makes harder to implement JS workflows, e.g., to compressed or merged together multiple files before being included in a page.
        3. It can make loading slower (because files are not optimized or because they block loading the rest of the page).

        So you link an external file with the src attribute. There is a file inside the js/ folder named external_scripts.js. Load it in here.

    <!-- 

        Exercise 2. Accessing attributes
        //////////////////////////////////

        As we know, HTML elements are objects in JavaScript, meaning that their attributes are properties of these objects.

        a. Verify that the property id and name exist in those objects retrieved in exercise 1. You may use the dot notation (.), as we did before, or try the getAttribute() method. What's the difference? None.
        

        b. You may also use the setAttribute() method.
